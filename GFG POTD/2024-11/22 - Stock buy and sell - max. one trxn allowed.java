// Given an array prices[] of length n, representing the prices of the stocks on
// different days. The task is to find the maximum profit possible by buying and
// selling the stocks on different days when at most one transaction is allowed.
// Here one transaction means 1 buy + 1 Sell. If it is not possible to make a
// profit then return 0.

// Note: Stock must be bought before being sold.

// Examples:
// Input: prices[] = [7, 10, 1, 3, 6, 9, 2]
// Output: 8
// Explanation: You can buy the stock on day 2 at price = 1 and sell it on day 5
// at price = 9. Hence, the profit is 8.

// Input: prices[] = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: Here the prices are in decreasing order, hence if we buy any day
// then we cannot sell it at a greater price. Hence, the answer is 0.

// Input: prices[] = [1, 3, 6, 9, 11]
// Output: 10
// Explanation: Since the array is sorted in increasing order, we can make
// maximum profit by buying at price[0] and selling at price[n-1].

// Constraint:
// 1 <= prices.size()<= 105
// 0 <= prices[i] <=104

class Solution {
    public int maximumProfit(int prices[]) {
        // Code here
        if (prices.length < 2) {
            return 0;
        }
        int maxProfit = 0;
        
        int buyAt = prices[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > buyAt) {
                maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, prices[i] - buyAt);
            } else {
                buyAt = prices[i];
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
