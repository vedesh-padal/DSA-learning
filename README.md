# My DSA Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository dedicated to my journey in learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)! This repo contains the code I have written while studying and solving various DSA problems, which keeps me motivated to continue learning and improving my skills.

## Motivation

I created this repository to document my progress and revisit the problems I've solved. Each solution is an opportunity for me to learn and grow as a programmer.

## Language Used

All the solutions in this repository are implemented in **Java**.

## Repository Structure

The questions are categorized based on topics and concepts, including:

- **Graphs**
- **Dynamic Programming**

Each folder contains a set of DSA problems along with my understanding, comments in the code, and problem descriptions for some of the questions.

## Acknowledgments

Some of the problems are from the DSA Playlists I followed during my learning journey (takeUforward / striver, gfg), while others are challenges I encountered and solved independently.


Thank you for visiting my repository! Happy coding!
